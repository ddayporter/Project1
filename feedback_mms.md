# Project Feedback + Evaluation


## Project Workflow

> Did you complete the user stories, wireframes, task tracking, and/or ERDs, as specified above? Did you use source control as expected for the phase of the program youâ€™re in (detailed above)?

**Exceeds Expectations**. Your project is very clearly scoped and your user stories show that.  You've expressed yourself well in the readme.  In the future, it would be nice to see more evidence of your planning process, like the hand-drawn images you refer to and stories created for the steps you allude to in your "approach" discussion.

## Technical Requirements

> Did you deliver a project that met all the technical requirements? Given what the class has covered so far, did you build something that was reasonably complex?

**Meets Expectations**. Congratulations.  All the concepts covered during the first few week of WDI are represented.  You have tackled some complex problems.

## Code Quality

> Did you follow code style guidance and best practices covered in class, such as spacing, modularity, and semantic naming? Did you comment your code as your instructors have in class?

**Exceeds Expectations**. Html is clearly structured. Code is well organized.  CSS is clear (with a few commented out rules).   In the future, watch for duplication and areas where you can group functionality into functions.

## Problem Solving

> Are you able to defend why you implemented your solution in a certain way? Can you demonstrate that you thought through alternative implementations?

**Exceeds Expectations**. Excellent job on this project! I would really like to see you support different groups of questions (difficulty, specific books).
